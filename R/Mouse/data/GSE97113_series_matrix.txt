!Series_summary	"Numerous neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, display a sex-biased prevalence. To identify molecular correlates of this sex bias, we investigated sex-differences in molecular pathology in the hippocampus using the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease during early stages of disease progression (1, 2, and 4 months of age)."
!Series_overall_design	"Hippocampal mRNA from 1, 2, and 4 month old male and female 5XFAD mice were analyzed by RNA sequencing of 5 biological replicates using an Illumina HiSeq 2500"
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
